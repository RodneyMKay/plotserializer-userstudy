# Thesis Template

This is a template project for theses or student research assistants that you can fork and use.

## Short How-To for WiMis (not relevant for students)
[Fork this project](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/forking_workflow.html) by clicking on `Fork` on the main project page.

Select a namespace for your project, i.e., where you want to store your forked project. This is probably somewhere within the `TU-DA Fluidsystemtechnik` group, such as `TU-DA Fluidsystemtechnik/Projects/emergenCITY`.

You can rename your project to fit the purpose better, such as `Master Thesis Foo Bar` and adjust the description.
