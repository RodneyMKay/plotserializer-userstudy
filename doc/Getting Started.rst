Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------
Install PlotSerializer by running

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install plot-serializer


Serializing your first plot
---------------------------
We will serialize an example matplotlib plot that we have created as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()

    np.random.seed(19680801)

    X = np.round(np.linspace(0.5, 3.5, 100), 3)
    Y1 = 3 + np.cos(X)
    Y2 = 1 + np.cos(1 + X / 0.75) / 2

    ax.set_xlim(0, 4)
    ax.set_ylim(0, 4)

    ax.tick_params(which="major", width=1.0, length=10, labelsize=14)
    ax.tick_params(which="minor", width=1.0, length=5, labelsize=10, labelcolor="0.25")

    ax.grid(linestyle="--", linewidth=0.5, color=".25", zorder=-10)

    ax.plot(X, Y1, c="C0", lw=2.5, label="Blue signal", zorder=10)
    ax.plot(X, Y2, c="C1", lw=2.5, label="Orange signal")

    ax.set_title("Example figure", fontsize=20, verticalalignment="bottom")
    ax.set_xlabel("TIME in s", fontsize=14)
    ax.set_ylabel("DISTANCE in m", fontsize=14)
    ax.legend(loc="upper right", fontsize=14)


Of particular interest are the two following lines:

.. code-block:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()

To collect the data from the plot, we want to serialize, we first need to create a ``Serializer`` object.
Specifically, since we're looking at matplotlib in this case, we need to create a ``MatplotlibSerializer``.
The ``MatplotlibSerializer`` also exposes a ``subplots()``-Method.
This way the ``Serializer`` is able to capture everything you do with the returned objects.

In concrete terms, we replace the two lines above with the following code:

.. code-block:: python

    from plot_serializer.matplotlib.serializer import MatplotlibSerializer

    serializer = MatplotlibSerializer()
    fig, ax = serializer.subplots()

Optionally, we can add some metadata to the resulting Json:

.. code-block:: python

    serializer.add_custom_metadata("date_created", "10.01.2023")

Finally, get the resulting Json string, we can invoke the ``json()``-Method on the serializer:

.. code-block:: python

    serializer.to_json()

We can also write the plot to a file directly:

.. code-block:: python

    serializer.write_json_file("test_plot.json")



What does, what does not get serialized?
----------------------------------------
Nochmal Ã¼berarbeiten. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
PlotSerializer always reads out the data and colors. For some plots you explicitely have to ask for the colors to be shown inside the JSON.
Further supported parameters for the specific diagram type are explained in this documentation. Add those pages!
Parameters which are used to make the diagram more appealing are not extracted by PlotSerializer. Instead they might distort the data in the JSON file.
Because of this we recommend to run PlotSerializer first with your raw data, run it once, and simply add the all stylish choices for the plot after that.
Similarly beware of modifying anywhere else besides the main methods, such as plot,pie,scatter. This will not be caught upon by PlotSerializer and the change will be ignored.
Example.
