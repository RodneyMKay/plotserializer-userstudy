Welcome to Plot Serializer's documentation!
===========================================

Plot Serializer is a tool for creating easily readable JSON files for your scientific diagrams.
It increases the transparency of scientific publications by helping you share data from your diagrams - with the option of providing custom metadata.
It's simple and hassle-free!

Note: Plot Serializer is currently under development and its functionality is limited to 2D line plots, pie plots and bar plots. More will come soon!
